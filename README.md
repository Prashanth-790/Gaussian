# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the NumPy library and define the matrix containing the coefficients and constants.
2. Convert the matrix into an upper triangular form.
3. Solve for the variables, starting from the last row and working upwards.
4. Conclude the program.
